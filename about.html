        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>breathtaker1 was born from a simple frustration: wind instrumentalists had no intuitive way to control synthesizers. Traditional MIDI controllers are designed with pianists in mind, leaving wind players to adapt their technique to an unfamiliar interface.</p>
        <p>As a musician and developer, I spent years crafting a solution that allows saxophone players to use their existing fingering knowledge to control digital instruments naturally, without requiring special hardware.</p>
        <p>What began as a passion project has evolved into a MIDI solution that brings the familiar fingering patterns of wind instruments into the digital realm, making electronic music production more accessible for saxophone, flute, and clarinet players.</p>

      <div class="about-text">
        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p>breathtaker1 uses sophisticated key-mapping algorithms to convert keyboard combinations into MIDI notes. Our patented fingering detection system recognizes complex combinations and transitions, allowing for realistic wind instrument emulation.</p>
        <p>The software features adjustable latency settings (20-100ms) to match your playing style, along with special note hold modes that help sustain notes when needed. It also includes built-in transposition options for Eb saxophones and Bb tenor instruments.</p>
        <p>Currently available exclusively for macOS, breathtaker1 leverages the platform's robust MIDI capabilities and integrates seamlessly with DAWs through the IAC Driver for virtual MIDI routing.</p>
