        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Breathtaker was born from a simple frustration: wind instrumentalists had no intuitive way to control synthesizers. Traditional MIDI controllers are designed with pianists in mind, leaving wind players to adapt their technique to an unfamiliar interface.</p>
        <p>Our team of musicians and developers spent three years crafting a solution that allows saxophone, flute, clarinet, and other wind players to use their existing skills to control digital instruments naturally.</p>

        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p>Breathtaker uses advanced signal processing to translate keyboard input into expressive wind controller data. Our proprietary algorithms analyze your playing style to create natural dynamics, articulations, and expression.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional MIDI controllers, Breathtaker responds to the nuances of wind playing techniques, allowing for bends, falls, growls, and other expressions that are essential to wind instrument performance.</p>
