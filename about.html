          <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
          <p>I had the idea for a computer keyboard-based MIDI saxophone controller a few years ago. As a producer/saxophonist I became tired of the workflow of having to either write in MIDI notes by hand or play them on a MIDI keyboard. None of these processes are particularly fun for me, they just felt like means to an end.</p>
          <p>I had an Akai EWI 5000, and I never loved the feel of it: the octave rollers are clunky, and the key sensors don't provide a tactile response. Plus, I always felt a bit silly blowing air into the plastic breath sensor…it just doesn't make sense to me!</p>
          <p>breathtaker1 was born from this frustration: wind instrumentalists had no intuitive way to control synthesizers. Traditional MIDI controllers are designed with pianists in mind, leaving wind players to adapt their technique to an unfamiliar interface.</p>
          <p>What began as a passion project has evolved into a MIDI solution that brings the familiar fingering patterns of wind instruments into the digital realm, making electronic music production more accessible for saxophone, flute, and clarinet players.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm Brian Bibb, a professional musician and software developer with a passion for music technology. I created breathtaker1 to solve a problem I experienced firsthand: the need for wind players to have intuitive control over digital instruments.</p>
            <p>By combining my expertise in saxophone performance with software development, breathtaker1 was born - a tool designed to understand the specific key combinations and fingering techniques used by wind instrument players.</p>
