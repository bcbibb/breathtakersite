        <h2>What is breathtaker1?</h2>
        <p>breathtaker1 is a software plugin that maps your computer keyboard to wind instrument fingerings. It recognizes combinations of key presses that correspond to saxophone fingering patterns and converts them to MIDI notes. It includes velocity control, adjustable latency, note hold mode, and transposition features specifically designed for wind players.</p>

        <h2>Do I need special hardware to use breathtaker1?</h2>
        <p>No! That's the beauty of breathtaker1. It works with your standard computer keyboard and a virtual MIDI connection to your DAW. No additional hardware is required, though you'll need a virtual MIDI device (like IAC Driver on Mac) to connect to your DAW.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Will breathtaker1 work with my DAW?</h2>
        <p>breathtaker1 is compatible with all major macOS DAWs including Logic Pro, Ableton Live, FL Studio, Pro Tools, Cubase, Reaper, and Studio One. It's available as a VST3, AU, and standalone app, allowing it to integrate with virtually any music production environment that accepts MIDI input.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Is breathtaker1 available for Windows?</h2>
        <p>Currently, breathtaker1 is only available for macOS 10.14 or later. We are working on a Windows version which we hope to release in the future. Sign up for our newsletter to be notified when the Windows version becomes available.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>How does breathtaker1 actually work?</h2>
        <p>breathtaker1 uses a sophisticated key detection system with adjustable latency (20-100ms) that gives you time to complete fingering combinations before registering a note. This latency window allows the software to detect complex fingering patterns that mimic saxophone fingerings, rather than immediately playing a note as soon as you press a key. This is crucial for allowing proper wind instrument fingering techniques to work with a standard keyboard.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>What kind of MIDI integration does breathtaker1 support?</h2>
        <p>breathtaker1 works with internal virtual MIDI connections. On Mac, we recommend using the IAC Driver for internal routing to your DAW. The software sends standard MIDI notes with velocity data and can use MIDI CC11 for expression control.</p>
