        <h2>What is breathtaker1?</h2>
        <p>breathtaker1 is a software plugin that maps your computer keyboard to wind instrument fingerings. It recognizes combinations of key presses that correspond to saxophone fingering patterns and converts them to MIDI notes. It includes velocity control, adjustable latency, note hold mode, and transposition features specifically designed for wind players.</p>

        <h2>Do I need special hardware to use breathtaker1?</h2>
        <p><strong>No special hardware required, but your keyboard matters.</strong><br><br>
breathtaker1 works with any standard computer keyboard - no wind controllers, breath sensors, or special MIDI hardware needed. You just need:<br>
• A Mac computer<br>
• Any keyboard (including mac laptop keyboard)<br>
• Your DAW or music software<br><br>
<strong>The keyboard caveat:</strong> Most keyboards struggle with multiple simultaneous key presses. Since saxophone fingerings often require 3-4 keys at once, cheaper keyboards may not register certain note combinations.<br><br>
<strong>For best results:</strong> Consider an "NKRO" gaming keyboard or any mechanical gaming keyboard ($35-100). These handle complex key combinations reliably.<br><br>
<strong>What you DON'T need:</strong> Breath controllers, special MIDI hardware, audio interfaces, or expensive studio equipment.<br><br>
The beauty of breathtaker1 is democratizing wind controller playing without the typical $500+ hardware investment. Start with your current keyboard and upgrade only if you experience note registration issues.</p>
